SpellCheck 1.00 (for P&P 3.20 or higher)
---------------
I loosely based this addon off of input21.mrc by CodeRx.
(all the code is mine, however.) It basically checks whatever
you say in a channel, chat, or query for common mistakes in
spelling. The default dictionary handles a few common mistakes.
As you make new ones, use the /word command or popups (in
the P&P menu) to add them to the dictionary.

The popups are pretty self-explanitory, but I will explain
them anyways-

Add word: Allows you to enter a misspelled word, and the
          correct version, then adds it to the dictionary.
          Also can be done via /word (incorrect) (correct)

Remove word: Allows you to remove a word from the spelling
             dictionary. Also can be done via /word -r (word)

On: Enable SpellCheck.
Off: Disable SpellCheck.

The remaining options tell SpellCheck what to do if errors are
found.

Tell me corrections made:
     If errors are found, they are listed. The corrected text
     is said in the window as normal.

Make corrections silently:
     If errors are found, they are corrected in the said text,
     but nothing special is shown to you.

Full halt if any errors:
     If errors are found, they are listed, and NOTHING is said
     in the channel or query/chat. You must correct them manually
     (or change the dictionary, or turn off SpellCheck) to output
     the text.

Notes
-----
This addon will not spell check text that IRCrypt encrypts. It will
not work with nick completion- if you make a spelling error, it will
be corrected, and nick completion (or click n color) will not be
activated.

This WILL spell check 'around' punctuation, color codes, etc. as long
as they are not embedded in the middle of the word.
