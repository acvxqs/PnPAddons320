Quick start-
In most cases, the whiteboard will be used by having one user setup a whiteboard "server"
and all other users connecting to that whiteboard.  To start a whiteboard server, type
/wb.  To connect to another user's server, type /wb nick or /wb IP, giving the nickname
or address (IP or named host) of the user.  Once connected, you can select tools and colors
from the right, draw in the drawing area, and chat in the chat window. (if it does not open
automatically, select *Chat/Users* to open it.) Close the whiteboard window and you will
disconnect automatically.
 
Popups-
A small menu of popups has been added to the P&P Tools menu to quickly start up the
whiteboard. You can choose to start it in server mode, connect to someone else, start it
up in a channel, or start it up locally only, as well as a few other options.
 
Details on ports-
By default, the whiteboard is on port 5050.  You can open a whiteboard server on a different
port by using /wb port, and connect to a server on a different port by using /wb nick/IP port.
You probably don't need to use a different port, but this is available just in case it is needed.
 
Running in a channel-
The whiteboard has a special mode where you can run it "in" a channel. Instead of sending
the whiteboard data via a special connection, it will be sent via CTCP to the entire channel.
If IRC lag is not a concern, this is a good way to run a whiteboard for more than a few users.
 
To activate this mode, type /wb #channel. Note that the whiteboard will refuse to run in this
mode unless you are on the channel and it either has [whiteboard] in the topic or the mode
+l 5050 set. (a limit of 5050) This prevents random users from sending a lot of whiteboard junk
to channels without permission of the ops to run whiteboards first.
 
Local mode-
If you just want to fool around with the whiteboard without connecting or accepting connections,
you can type /wb 0 or /wb local to start it in local mode. This mode will also be switched to
automatically if you are disconnected from the whiteboard server.
 
Details on tools-
The freehand tool allows you to draw, well, freehand.  The lines tool allows you to draw
straight lines- Click where you want to start the line and drag to where you wish to end the
line, then let go.  The line series tool allows you to draw lots of connected lines- Click to start,
then click at each line end point.  Double-click to place the final line.
 
The rectangle and box tools draw filled and hollow rectangles- Click at one corner, and drag
to where you want the other corner, then let go.  The ellipse and doughnut tools draw
filled and hollow ellipses/circles- Just like the rectangles, drag from one corner to the other
and release.  The doughnut will always draw in "inverse" due to mIRC limitations.
 
Fill allows you to fill an enclosed area with the current color, and text writes text at the
position you click at.
 
Tool options-
If you have inverse on, most tools (excepting freehand and line series) will draw in "inverse",
which will "reverse" anything it draws over.  Try it and see.  Doughnuts always draw in
"inverse" due to mIRC limitations.
 
The width setting can be used to change the size of lines and hollow objects; you can
increase or decrease it by one using the menu or right-click and select any width from
the popup menu.
 
The color can be changed to any of the built in colors or selected from a custom color
menu.  The built in colors will ALWAYS use the mIRC default colors, even if you have
changed them in your copy of mIRC.  This is to ensure that your drawings look the same
for all whiteboard users.
 
Other neat things in the popups- (including BMP support)
If you right-click in the whiteboard, you can select from a lot of options and settings. From
here you can clear the whiteboard or fill it with the current color.  You can also load a
picture.  The other users will ONLY see this picture IF they also have that file in either
their mIRC directory, download directory, or a special pictures directory they have defined.
(you can define the pictures directory in the settings submenu.)
 
Chat and userlist window-
Selecting *Chat/Users* from the whiteboard will open the chat and userlist window. It
will also open automatically if anyone says something in it and it isn't already open. Here
you can see who is on the whiteboard at a glance, and send messages and actions just
like in a normal IRC channel, for all whiteboard users to see.
 
You can select a nickname and right-click for a few options, such as whois'ing the user
on IRC, or kicking/banning the user from the whiteboard IF you are running the server.
 
Settings-
A large number of settings can be configured by right-clicking in the whiteboard and
selecting the settings submenu.
 
The Redraw setting determines how the whiteboard is drawn. "Smooth" draws it
with as little flicker as possible, but is slower. "Fast" draws objects faster but may
flicker noticeably.
 
You can change the font and size used for the Text tool here, as well as turn bold on or
off.
 
You can change some settings related to the chat/userlist box, such as whether it opens
automatically when you start the whiteboard, whether users entering and exiting the
whiteboard are shown "joining" and "parting", and what special colors to use for the
nicknames of the server and yourself. (just to highlight them in the userlist.)
 
You can set the whiteboard windows to be opened as desktop windows if you prefer this
type of window. Changes to this setting don't take affect until the whiteboard is restarted.
 
Finally, you can change the directory that is searched for BMP pictures, in addition to
your download and mIRC directories.
 
If you are the server, you can also change an additional setting in the Server submenu.
Here you can limit connections to the whiteboard.  You can allow all connections, no new
connections, or limit the user count to a certain number of users. (for example, you could
set it so that no more than 5 total users could connect to the whiteboard at one time. This
could be used to limit bandwidth usage, etc.) The user limit does not count you in the
number of users.
 
Sizing concerns-
Obviously, different users have different sized screens. If someone draws outside of the
size of another user's window, they won't see it.
 
The main whiteboard window ALWAYS opens up at a set size for this reason, a bit
smaller than the main mIRC window on a 800x600 resolution. You can resize it if you
like, however all users should agree beforehand how big to make it. The best way would
be to have the user with the smallest resolution size it to their taste, then draw a rectangle
at the edges so the other users know where the limits are.
 
If needed, the server can use the options in the whiteboard popups under
Server -> Size Limit to "force" all current users' and new users' windows to be the same
size as the server's current window. After this change however, the users can freely
resize the window again.
 
Bandwidth/flooding concerns-
The basic connection mode of the whiteboard should not be burden on your bandwidh
as the data sent and received is relatively small. The whiteboard server will experience
a greater load as it has to re-relay all data it receives from one user to all other users.
 
If only two or three total users are connected, bandwidth will not be a problem. If a larger
number of users are connected you may notice lag in drawing, especially if the server
is only a standard dialup connection. If possible, try to get someone on a high speed
line (ISDN, cable modem, etc.) to be the whiteboard server if you plan on having a large
number of connections.
 
If you run the whiteboard in a channel, obviously a much larger number of users can be
easily supported. mIRC's built-in flood protection combined with some special measures
taken by the whiteboad SHOULD prevent anyone from flooding off due to sending
whiteboard information, however users should still be careful when using the freehand
feature due to the large amount of info it sends. The CTCPs sent by the whiteboard
have little chance of affecting users not connected to the whiteboard.
 
Color concerns-
The whiteboard works best under 16 bbp (65535 colors) or higher depths of colors. Anything
less (such as a 256 color mode) will display dithered colors when you fill or use many other
tools, which not only looks worse but may cause problems when trying to fill over them.
